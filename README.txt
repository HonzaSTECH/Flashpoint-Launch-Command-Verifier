How to use this little utility
==============================
Well, it's simple. Just launch the .exe application (Flashpoint Launch Command Verifier.exe) and wait a few seconds for the database of launch commands to load. Then, just paste your launch command into the console by right-clicking and hit enter. The application will immediately tell you if the bot would mark this as a duplicate.

Are you getting warning, that the file is a virus?
==================================================
Well, don't worry about that. Your antivirus most likely marks anything with a .exe extension that you downloaded from the internet and doesn't have a certificate as a virus.
